# Euclid-s-algorithm
(1).Using Subtracion,
The original version of Euclidâ€™s algorithm is based on subtraction: for the above program we recursively subtract the smaller number from the larger.
(2).Using division, we call a function while a is not
divisible by b.
(3).Using binary,This algorithm finds the gcd using only subtraction, binary representation, shifting and parity testing. We will use a divide and conquer technique.
But they are both reculsive functions


The file gcd shows the implementation of euclid's alogrithm using division.
